This Privacy Policy describes how The 13th Turn ("the App") handles your data. By using the App, you agree to the practices described here.

1. Data Collection & Usage

Camera: The App requests access to the camera to apply real-time "glitch" filters and visual effects for narrative immersion. We do not record, store, or transmit any photos or video footage.

Location: The App uses Coarse Location (approximate) to customize in-game text (the "Whispers"). This data is processed locally on your device and is never sent to our servers.

In-App Purchases: All transactions are handled securely by Apple’s StoreKit. We do not have access to your credit card or bank details.

2. Third-Party Services (Advertising)

The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use certain data, such as your device's Advertising Identifier (IDFA), to personalize ads.

You can learn more about how Google uses data here: Google Privacy & Terms.

3. Data Retention

We do not store any personal data on external servers. All game progress and "Neural Charges" are stored locally on your device. If you delete the App, this local data may be removed.

4. Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
